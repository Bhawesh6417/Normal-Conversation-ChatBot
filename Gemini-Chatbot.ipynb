            "    *   **Job Displacement:** Investment in education and training programs, exploring universal basic income, and fostering entrepreneurship.\n",
            "    *   **Social Isolation:**  Promoting digital wellbeing, encouraging face-to-face interactions, and designing technologies that facilitate real-world connections.\n",
            "    *   **Environmental Impact:**  Sustainable manufacturing practices, e-waste recycling initiatives, and investing in renewable energy technologies.\n",
